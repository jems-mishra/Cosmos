The cosmos means universe. Using the word cosmos rather than 'universe'  implies <br />
viewing the universe as a complex and orderly  <div class="tooltip"> system <span class=" tooltiptext "> sysyem is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a uniform whole.A system is delineated by its spatial and <br />
temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by environment. decsribed by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subject of study od system theory.</span> </div>
 or entity; the opposite of <span id="blue">chaos.</span> <br />
The cosmos and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance are studied <br />
 in <span id="blue"> cosmology</span>- a very broad discipline covering any scientific , religious or philosophical  <br />
contemplations of the cosmos and its nature , or reasons for existing. Religious and <br />
 philosophical approaches may include in the concepts of the cosmos various spiritual <br />
entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe. 
<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 
<h1 style="color: green">ETYMOLOGY</h1>
<hr style="width: 80%; margin-left: 0;"/>

The philosopher <span id="blue">Pythagoras</span> first used the term Cosmos ( <span id="blue">Ancient Greek: &#954&#948&#963&#956&#959&#958</span> ) for the order of the universe. <br />
The term became part of modern language in the 19<sup>th</sup> century when geographer-polymath<span id="blue">Alexander von Humbdolt</span> resurrected the use of the word from the ancient greek,  <br />
assigned it his five-volume trestise, <span id="blue"><i> Kosmos </i></span>, which inflenced modern and somewhat <span id="blue">holistic</span> perception of the universe as one interacting <span id="blue">entity.</span>

<span id="blue">Cosmology</span> is the study of the cosmos, and its broadset sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific ,
religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being.
In this way, most religious and <span id="blue">philosophical</span> systems have a cosmology. when <i>cosmology</i> is used without a qualifier, it often
signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.
<br /> <br />  <br /><br />

<h1 style="color: yellow">PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY</h1>
<hr />
It is the scientific studty of the universe frpm the beginning of its physical existence. It includes spculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being <br />
discussed. In <span id="blue">physical cosmology</span>, the trm cosmos is often used in a technical way, referring to  a particular <span id="blue">spacetime</span> continum within <br />
a <span id="blue">multiverse</span>. Our particular cosmos, the <span id="blue">observable universe</span>  is generally capitalized as <i>Cosmos</i>. In physical cosmology,<br />
the uncapitalized term <b>cosmic</b> signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as <i>'cosmic time' , <span id="blue">'cosmic rays' </span>and <span id="blue">'cosmic microwave background'.</i></span>
<br /> <br />  <br /><br />

<h1 style="color: yellow">PHILISOPHICAL COSMOLOGY</h1>
<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left: 0;"/>
<img src="C:\Users\Riya\Desktop\CSS\pic3.jpg" style="float:right; width:350px; height: 235px; margin-right: 140px;" />
Cosmolgy is a branch of <span id="blue">Metaphysics</span> that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory of doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.
The basic definition of this is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy, the <span id="blue">Big Bang Theory </span> is the 
dominant postulation. It is an expanding discipline, directed to the conceptual foundations of cosmology and the philosophical contemplation of
the universe as a totality. It draws on many theories of physics -- thermodynamics , statistical mechanics , quantum field theory and special and general relativity --
and on several branches of philosophy -- philosophy of physics , philosophy of science , metaphysics , philosophy of mathematics and epistemology.
<br /> <br />  <br /><br />

<h1 style="color: yellow">RELIGIOUS COSMOLOGY</h1>
<hr />
In <span id="blue"> theology </span>, the cosmos is the <span id="blue">created</span> heavenly bodies. The concept of as the created universe and its arrangemnt has been important<br />
in <span id="blue"> Christendom </span> since its very inception, as it is heavily used in the <span id="blue">New Testament</span> and occurs over 180 times. In <span id="blue">Christian theology,</span><br />
the word is sometimes used synonymously with <span id="blue">aion</span> to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the<br />
<span id="blue">afterlife</span> or <span id="blue">world to come,</span> although "aion/aeon"is also at times used in a more other-worldly sense as the<br />
eternal plane of the divine

<h1 style="color: purple">EUROPEAN VIEW</h1>
<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left: 0;"/>
<img src="C:\Users\Riya\Desktop\CSS\pic1.jpg" style="float:right; width:350px; height: 235px; margin-right: 140px;" />
Early Europeans viewed the cosmos as a divinely created , spatially finite , bifurcated cosmos , divided into sublunary and superlunary realms.  Objects above 
the lunar disc were believed to be stable, with heavenly bodies believed to be made out of a refined substance called <span id="blue">quintessence</span>. This was understood
to be a crystalline,completely transparent substance that held all of the superlunary spheres in perfect order. After their creation by God, these spheres didn't
change except for their rotation above the earth. Objects below the lunar sphere were subject to constant combination, separation and recombination. This  
was because they consisted of the chaotic elements of earth , air , fire and water.
<br /> <br />  <br /><br />

<h1 style="color: purple">INDIAN VIEW</h1>
<hr />
It is generally known that the indians believed in a cyclic universe. This idea is related to three other beliefs: 
<ul>
<li>Time is endless and space has infinite extension. </li>
<li>Earth is not the center of the universe.</li>
<li>Laws include all development including the creation and destruction of the universe.  </li></ul>
It was believed that there are connections between the physical and psychological worlds, and an eqivalence existed between the outer cosmos and the<br /> 
inner cosmos of the individual. The indian cyclic model assumes the existence of countless island universes, which go through their own periods of <br /> 
development and destruction. The conception of cyclicity is taken to be recursive. For an early exposition of these astronomical and cosmological ideas,<br /> 
one may like to read classic history of indian science. composed in 1030 AD, and for an even earlier , popular view of Indian ideas, one may consult the<br /> 
great Vedantic text called the  <span id="blue">Yoga Vasistha </span>(YV), which at 32,000 shlokas is one of the longest books in world's literature.
<br /> <br />  <br /><br />

<h1 style="color: yellow">Similarities In Observation</h1>
There is one way that both the Europeans and Indians along with countless other ancient indian societies, related to cosmos. This was through meaning, placed on celestial<br /> 
bodies, that were observed moving above the Earth. The Chinese had a very comples astronomical understanding of the stars and the cosmos influenced everything from<br /> 
their art and architecture to their myths and science. This was also true of the Greeks and Romans, whose 48 constellations, including the zodiac signs and the constellation<br /> 
of Orion, have been passed down to , modern Western cultures. These were likely passed down to them from ancient Babylonian and Egyptian astronomers. Copernicus is <br /> 
said to have been inspired by the fecund sun deity of neoplatonic thought, which may have initially inspired his vision of a heliocentric universe.

<h4> HOW FAST IS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDING? </H4>
<img src="C:\Users\Riya\Desktop\CSS\expansion.jpg" align="center" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 500px; height: 300px;" />
<br /> <br /> 
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;">This question just keeps getting more confusing. Our two main mathods of measuring the acceleration of the Universe's expansion disagree by 9%. Astronomers have now
come up with another independent method that shoul have helped us decide the exact rate of acceleration, further muddying the waters. There are two primary methods  
of measuring this , which is decribed by a number called the <span id="beige">Hubble constant</span>. The First uses the cosmic miscrowave background (CMB), a relic of
the universe's first light, and tracks the expansion rate in the early universe to what it ought to be now according to our standard model of cosmology.
The Second uses what astronomers called the <span id="beige">Distance Ladder</span>. This relies on stars called Cepheid variables, which fluctuate in brightness at a rate
related to their absoulte luminosity. Knowing their brightnes allows us to measure their distance, which we use to determine the distances to nearby galaxies and then to
well-studied supernovae. These distances are compared with how fast the objects are moving away from us to derive the Hubble constant. But the fact is, we really don't
understand what the value of Hubble constant is, and that we need much more precise studies before we can claim that there must be some new type of exotic physics.</p>
